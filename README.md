# Base Mini Starter ðŸª©

A minimal idea inspired by Veenowayâ€™s Web3 projects but designed for **mobile-only builders**.

## ðŸ’¡ Concept
This repo showcases how an active Base user might structure a simple Web3 starter, even from a phone.
It doesnâ€™t include code â€” just the concept, structure, and commit examples for inspiration.

## ðŸ§© Structure
base-mini-starter/
â”œâ”€ README.md
â”œâ”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€ ideas/
â”‚   â”œâ”€ wagmi-config.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€ onchain-tasks.md
â”‚   â””â”€ ui-wireframe.md
â””â”€ commits/
    â”œâ”€ feat-initial.md
    â”œâ”€ refactor-readme.md

    ## ðŸš€ Vision
- Learn by observing real Web3 repos (like Veenowayâ€™s)
- Draft clean project ideas on mobile
- Prepare commit templates for future real builds

## ðŸ§  Next Step
When I move to desktop, this repo will evolve into a real Base + wagmi project.
Stay tuned.
